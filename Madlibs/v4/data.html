		<h1>Washington Redskins Change Their Name To The D.C. Redskins</h1>

		<p><span class="word" data-wordtype="place">WASHINGTON</span>— Following an outpouring of criticism from across the country, the Washington <span class="word" data-wordtype="noun">Redskins</span> announced Wednesday that they are officially changing the team’s name to the D.C. Redskins.</p>
		<p>“We’ve heard the concerns of many people who have been <span class="word" data-wordtype="adjective">hurt</span> or offended by the team’s previous name, and I’m happy to say we’ve now rectified the situation once and for all,” said franchise owner <span class="word" data-wordtype="noun">Dan Snyder</span>, adding that “Washington Redskins” will be replaced with “D.C. Redskins” on all team logos, uniforms, and apparel.</p>
		<p>It was a <span class="word" data-wordtype="adjective">difficult</span> decision—and one that, frankly, I’m a little embarrassed took me so long to make. So hopefully we can now put this issue to bed and start cheering on our D.C. Redskins.” In light of Snyder’s decision, <span class="word" data-wordtype="place">Cleveland</spa> Indians owner Larry Dolan told reporters he will change the feather in Chief Wahoo’s headdress from red to a “more appropriate” shade of red.</p>
