				/*any html elements you need to create for this project should be below all the divs. you may add css, but be warned that you shouldn't need to change the css that's already written. if you disagree, feel free. you may use any other plugins, libraries, boilerplates or frameworks that you like, but you won't be able to get out of writing thoughtful code. pay careful consideration to the order in which things happen, and things like timing, the animation queue, how new things relate to old things, scope and callback functions. good luck!


			task1: make it so that when the page loads, each div contains text labeling which div it is

			task2: when you click on one of my divs, that div should double in size via animation. include a reset button to put all divs back to original size.  

			task3: make it so that whenever you hover on any of my divs, the background color changes to orange. when you hover off, make it change back to what it was.
			extra points if you can figure out how to do this with animation

			task4: when you option-click (same as alt-click) on an element, make it so that it goes inside of div#one (refresh the page to undo)

			task5: include a button that will get rid of everything on the page, and animate the entire page red, then yellow, then orange over 5 seconds. then, after 5 seconds has elapsed, display the words 'Game Over' (Refresh to continue). 

			task6: whenever the user holds shift and clicks on a div, get rid of that div width some visual effect. (part ii: bonus if you can disable the operating system highlighting)

			task7: whenever a div goes away because of task6, if that leaves less than 5 divs, make all other divs big enough to fill the extra space left by any further absences
